### Custom Action System
- There is an actions setting in each detection item, and the format of the penalty operation is given below: 
- Penalty Type Object A[ Relation] Object B Other parameters 
- The penalty types supported by connecting multiple penalty operations with &&
- are as follows:
- `cancel` Lag back a player
- `log` Record the invalid action in NCP Logger，parameter `break The Cooling Time`
- `warn` Send a warning message to player，parameter `message The message you sent`
- `kick` Kick a player from server
- `ban` Ban a player from server，parameter `repeat Fault Tolerance Times`,`time Duration Of Ban`
- If no parameter is set, the plug-in will use NCP default value
- to add warning message, which needs to be added in string.

### NCP Commands Permission
- Set it in permission.policy, and the format is:
- `Permission: Command Table' 
- commands are connected by commas(,). 
- If there is no record of a command in NCP, all players can use it by default.
- For example, the version is not specified in nocheatplus.admin.all and nocheatplus.admin.helper of the case.

### NCP Custom Bypass Permission
Add them in permission.bypass，and the format is:
- `CheckType:Permissions(List)`
The player who has these permissions will bypass the check.

Availabe CheckType:
- `MOVING_SURVIVAL_FLY`
- `MOVING_CREATIVE_FLY`
- `MOVING_VEHICLE`
- `MOVING_SPEED`
- `MOVING_MORE_PACKETS`
- `MOVING_NO_FALL`
- `INVENTORY_INSTANT_EAT`
- `INVENTORY_OPEN`
- `INVENTORY_FAST_CLICK`
- `INVENTORY_MOVE`
- `FIGHT_SPEED`
