###### Related Plugins And Addons

* [NCPPlugin](https://cloudburstmc.org/resources/ncpplugin.896/)
  ------------------------------
  This is a debugging plugin, it can make your NCP only remind the kicked player through the Title without actually
  kicking it, it can be used to debug the configuration of the plugin.

 -------------------------------

* [ECCompatNCP](https://cloudburstmc.org/resources/eccompatncp.902/)
  ------------------------------
  This is a CPS detection extension component. It uses the detection algorithm of the well-known small game server
  EaseCation, and obtains cps at intervals. If it is higher than the threshold every time, the anti-cheat will kick it.
  Using this plugin will automatically close the CPS detection system of NCP itself.

 -------------------------------

* [NCPPanel](https://cloudburstmc.org/resources/ncppanel.906/)
  ------------------------------
  This is an extension component of NCP, which provides a visual operation panel and player reporting system for NCP.
  All of its language themes and even commands can be customized in configuration files.

 -------------------------------

* [CompatNCP](https://cloudburstmc.org/resources/compatncp.907/)
  ------------------------------
  This is an extension of NCP, which allows you to manually compatible with other plugins to reduce the misjudgment
  caused by anti-cheat due to non-support, such as double jump.

  ------------------------------

* [NCPLiteBan](https://cloudburstmc.org/resources/ncpliteban.912/)
  ------------------------------
  This is an extension plug-in of NCP, which synchronizes NCP ban data to the database for group server data
  synchronization, and relies on the plug-in DbLib. If you have NCPPanel installed, it can even sync panel data.

  ------------------------------

* [NCPStaticBar](https://cloudburstmc.org/resources/ncpstaticbar.913/)
  ------------------------------
  This is an extension for NCP that will turn your NCP into a passive static anti-cheat. Anti-cheat doesn't work
  normally, it only detects a player after it has been reported by other players. It does not have a reporting system
  itself, and NCPPanel needs to be installed.

  ------------------------------

* [NCPWebserver](https://github.com/Physical-Science-Academy/NCPWebserver)
  ------------------------------
  This simple and effective NCP Extension provides a web interface to manage the No-Cheat-Plus Anticheat on your Minecraft NukkitX server. With this plugin, server administrators can easily monitor and adjust settings for fair gameplay in a Webview without having to deal with manual configuration files.

### Custom Action System

- There is an actions setting in each detection item, and the format of the penalty operation is given below:
- Penalty Type Object A[ Relation] Object B Other parameters
- The penalty types supported by connecting multiple penalty operations with &&
- are as follows:
- `cancel` Lag back a player
- `log` Record the invalid action in NCP Logger，parameter `break The Cooling Time`
- `warn` Send a warning message to player，parameter `message The message you sent`
- `kick` Kick a player from server
- `ban` Ban a player from server，parameter `repeat Fault Tolerance Times`,`time Duration Of Ban`
- If no parameter is set, the plug-in will use NCP default value
- to add warning message, which needs to be added in string.

### NCP Commands Permission

- Set it in permission.policy, and the format is:
- ` Permission: Command Table `
- commands are connected by commas(,).
- If there is no record of a command in NCP, all players can use it by default.
- For example, the version is not specified in `nocheatplus.admin.all` and `nocheatplus.admin.helper` of the case.

### NCP Custom Bypass Permission

Add them in permission.bypass，and the format is:

- `CheckType:Permissions(List)`
  The player who has these permissions will bypass the check.

Available CheckType:

- `MOVING_SURVIVAL_FLY`
- `MOVING_CREATIVE_FLY`
- `MOVING_VEHICLE`
- `MOVING_SPEED`
- `MOVING_MORE_PACKETS`
- `MOVING_NO_FALL`
- `INVENTORY_INSTANT_EAT`
- `INVENTORY_OPEN`
- `INVENTORY_FAST_CLICK`
- `INVENTORY_MOVE`
- `FIGHT_SPEED`
- `FIGHT_REACH`
